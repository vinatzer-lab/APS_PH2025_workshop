# APS Plant Health 2025 workshop
Automated Analysis of Pathogen Genomes using PathogenSurveillance and the GenomeRxiv Web Server<br />
***Note: Please come to the workshop with a bacterial genome of interest to analyze (NCBI accession or FastA file)*** 

## Workshop Outline
### Introduction (5-10 min)
*Dr. Boris Vinatzer*<br>
Brief introduction to genomics and metagenomics in pathogen identification.
- Overview of the software used in the workshop and the respective development group

&nbsp;
### Part 1: Pathogen surveillance (45 min)
*Dr. Nik Grunwald, Dr. Martha Sudermann*<br>
Introduction and demo on use of Pathogen Surveillance pipeline for pathogen identification, variant detection, and biosurveillance. For interested in trying the software for themselves, a copy of the pipeline can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/1.0.0).

&nbsp;
### Part 2: GenomeRxiv (2.5 hours)

*Dr. Boris Vinatzer* <br>
Introduction to LINs (life identification number) and microbial taxonomy (5-10min).

*Reza Mazloom* <br>
A hands on demo of precise pathogen identification and analysis using the [GenomeRxiv web server](http://genomerxiv.org).
- Introduction to GenomeRxiv (5-10min)
- Presentation demo of GenomeRxiv and its features (15-20 min)
- Step-by-step hands-on demo of GenomeRxiv with your genome of interest (1 hour)
    - If you don't have a genome of interest, you may use ...



***---15 min break---*** 

*Sehgeet Kaur*<br>
Pathogen identification in metagenomic samples using GenomeRxiv (10 min)

*Kassaye Belay*<br>
Introduction to fungal GenomeRxiv (10 min)

*Mitchell Gercken*<br>
Introduction to viral GenomeRxiv (10 min)

&nbsp;
### Part 3: BrookLIN (~30-60 min)
*Reza Mazloom* <br>
Introduce BrookLIN the commandline interface for GenomeRxiv. There will be brief demo on how to add/identify genomes using sourmash's genome signature sketches and how results can be viewed on the GenomeRxiv web server.
