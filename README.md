# APS Plant Health 2025 workshop
Automated Analysis of Pathogen Genomes using PathogenSurveillance and the GenomeRxiv Web Server<br />
***Note: Please come to the workshop with a bacterial genome of interest to analyze (NCBI accession or FastA file)*** 

## Workshop Outline
### Introduction (15 min)
*Dr. Boris Vinatzer*<br>
Brief introduction to genomics and metagenomics in pathogen identification
- Overview of the software used in the workshop and the respective development group

&nbsp;
### Part 1: Pathogen surveillance
*Dr. Nik Grunwald, Dr. Martha Sudermann*<br>
Introduction and demo on use of Pathogen Surveillance pipeline for pathogen identification, variant detection, and biosurveillance. For interested in trying the software for themselves, a copy of the pipeline can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/pathogensurveillance/1.0.0).

### Part 2: Bacterial GenomeRxiv

*Dr. Boris Vinatzer* <br>
Introduction to LINs (life identification number) and microbial taxonomy.

*Sehgeet Kaur*<br>
Pathogen identification in metagenomic samples using GenomeRxiv

*Reza Mazloom* <br>
A hands on session of precise pathogen identification and analysis using the [GenomeRxiv web server](http://genomerxiv.org).
- Introduction to GenomeRxiv
- Presentation demo of GenomeRxiv and its features
- Step-by-step hands-on session of GenomeRxiv with your genome of interest
    - If you don't have a genome of interest, you may use ...

### Part 3: BrookLIN

*Reza Mazloom* <br>
Introduce BrookLIN the commandline interface for GenomeRxiv. There will be brief demo on how to add/identify genomes using sourmash's genome signature sketches and how results can be viewed on the GenomeRxiv web server. 

&nbsp;
### Part 4: GenomeRxiv beyond bacteria
*Mitchell Gercken*<br>
GenomeRxiv and Viruses

*Kassaye Belay*<br>
GenomeRxiv and Fungi
